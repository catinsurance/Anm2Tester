# Anm2Tester

## How to use:

1. Make sure your mod is enabled
2. Type the file path to the anm2 you want to test, i.e. "gfx/effects/effect_tumbleweed.anm2"
3. Press ENTER
4. Ta-da!!! It's that simple.

## Features:

- Config system so that you can quickly switch between different previews.
- Easily preview automatically listed animations and alter their playback speed.
- Select multiple different sprites to use for comparing size.
- Special empty 2x2 preview room for viewing sprites without distraction.
- Green screen and photo mode.

====================================================================================================

## Why I made this:

- The official anm2 editor does not accurately depict animations at the speed they are in game.
- Additionally, it can be hard to get a good scale reference when making animations and sprites.
- Lastly, I wanted to be able to record videos of animations a lot easier, since the gif exporter in the anm2 editor also depicts animations way too fast.
