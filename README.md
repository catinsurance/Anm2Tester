# Anm2Tester

### This was written in Notepad as a .txt file so it isn't pretty yet
 
How to use:

First, open the mod's directory (you're already there, so good job!). Navigate to the _Your_Files_ folder:

resources -> gfx -> _Your_Files_

Now, open that folder and put your .anm2 file there, along with any spritesheets it uses.

** MAKE SURE YOUR ANM2 IS POINTING TO THE SPRITESHEET CORRECTLY! **

** IT'LL BE A BLACK BOX WITH A RED "X" IN THE ISAAC ANIMATION EDITOR IF IT IS NOT CORRECT. **

Congratulations, you've finished the hardest part! Go into game and open the Dead Sea Scrolls menu (the button is [C] by default).

Navigate to the "anm2 tester" page, and type in the name of your .anm2 file. Typing the file extension is not necessary.
** This is CaSe SeNsItIvE!! Type it in correctly! **

Hit the "Load" button and view your anm2 in game! Type in the name of your animation to play it (this also case sensitive). Animations you've played before will be stored on a list for easy access.

====================================================================================================

Features:

- Simple interface.
- Easily preview animations and alter their playback speed.
- Switch between animations that you've already played before easily.
- Select multiple different sprites to use for comparing size.
- Special, empty 2x2 preview room for viewing sprites without distraction.

====================================================================================================

Why I made this:

It's important to maintain a consistent scale when making sprites, especially enemies. You don't want to make your enemy super huge, or your boss super small.
I'm hoping this tool will help people compare the scale of their sprite next to Isaac or other enemies.
